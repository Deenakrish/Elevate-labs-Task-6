                            Password Security Evaluation Report

This repository contains an analysis of password strength based on multiple test passwords, feedback from online password strength checkers, and research on common password attacks.

    Overview

For this task, several passwords with different complexity levels were created and tested. The goal was to understand how password structure affects security and to identify best practices for creating strong passwords.

    Passwords Used for Testing

The following passwords were analyzed:

1. 123456789
2. Gowtham
3. Gowtham@123
4. Gowthamarjun@123
5. Gowtham@123456
6. gowtham20

These were intentionally chosen to represent weak, medium, and moderately strong patterns.

    Strength Test Summary

Each password was tested using an online password strength checker. Results showed:

123456789 – Very Weak (simple sequence)
Gowtham – Very Weak (dictionary word, personal name)
Gowtham@123 – Weak/Medium (predictable pattern)
Gowthamarjun@123 – Medium (long but based on names)
Gowtham@123456 – Medium (pattern-based)
gowtham20 – Weak (name + small number)


    Common feedback included:

"Too predictable"
"Contains personal information"
"Low complexity"
"Commonly used pattern"

    What I Learned

Longer passwords offer significantly more protection.
Using a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols increases strength.
Avoid using personal information like names, ages, or common words.
Random or unrelated passphrases are more secure.
Predictable patterns like Name@123 are weak even with symbols.

    Common Password Attacks

Brute Force: Tries all possible combinations.
Dictionary Attack: Uses lists of common passwords or names.
Credential Stuffing: Uses leaked passwords on other sites.
Phishing: Tricks users into revealing passwords.

Password complexity helps defend especially against brute force and dictionary attacks.

    Final Recommendations

Based on the evaluation:
Use 12–16+ characters.
Avoid personal details like names or birthdays.
Use a mix: Uppercase + lowercase + numbers + symbols.
Prefer unique passwords for each account.
Use strong passphrases like: Silver!River7Cloud?
