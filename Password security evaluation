                                            Task 6-Password Security Evaluation Report

1. Multiple Passwords with Varying Complexity

A set of passwords was created with different levels of complexity. The passwords used for the analysis were:

1. 123456789 – Very weak, numeric sequence
2. Gowtham – Weak, single word and personal name
3. Gowtham@123 – Medium, includes symbol and numbers but predictable
4. Gowthamarjun@123 – Medium, long but uses personal information
5. Gowtham@123456 – Medium, includes symbol and digits but still patterned
6. gowtham20 – Weak, lowercase name plus two digits

These passwords represented a spectrum from extremely weak to moderately strong, allowing evaluation across different complexity levels.

2. Use of Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, Symbols, and Length Variations Use of Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, Symbols, and Length Variations

The passwords included:

Lowercase-only passwords
Mixed-case passwords
Passwords with numbers
Passwords with symbols
Long and short passwords

3. Testing Passwords on Strength Checker

Each password was tested using an online password strength checker(bitwarden) to evaluate resistance against common attacks.

4. Scores and Feedback from the Tool

The password checker provided feedback for each password. A summary of the evaluations is below:
123456789 – Very Weak (Common sequence, easily brute‑forced)
Gowtham – Very Weak (Dictionary word, personal name, low entropy)
Gowtham@123 – Weak/Medium (Contains symbol and numbers but predictable pattern)
Gowthamarjun@123 – Medium (Longer but uses full personal names, making it guessable)
Gowtham@123456 – Medium (More digits but still follows a predictable pattern)
gowtham20 – Weak (Lowercase name with simple number suffix)

The tool repeatedly noted weaknesses such as:

"Too predictable"
"Contains personal information"
"Commonly used pattern"
"Low complexity"

5. Best Practices Identified for Creating Strong Passwords Best Practices Identified for Creating Strong Passwords

Key best practices observed:

Use longer passwords (12+ characters)
Include all character types (upper, lower, digits, symbols)
Avoid common words or patterns
Avoid personal information
Use passphrases for readability and strength

6. Tips Learned from the Evaluation

Password length significantly boosts strength
Symbols and numbers drastically increase entropy
Avoid predictable substitutions like "P@ssw0rd"
Unique passwords for each account reduce overall risk
Passphrases (e.g., "River!Cloud7Horse?") are both strong and memorable


7. Research on Common Password Attacks

Common attack types studied:

Brute Force: Automated guessing of all possible combinations
Dictionary Attacks: Uses lists of known/common passwords
Credential Stuffing: Using breached credentials across multiple sites
Phishing: Trick users into revealing passwords


8. Summary: How Password Complexity Affects Security

The evaluation showed that passwords containing personal names or predictable patterns were significantly weaker. 
Even longer passwords became vulnerable when they included personal data or common structures. 
Randomness and variety of character types greatly increased strength. 
Password complexity was directly linked to higher resistance against brute‑force and dictionary attacks.

Password Recommendations:

Based on the findings, the following recommendations were concluded:
Passwords should have been at least 12–16 characters.
They should have included uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
Personal information such as names, birth years, or common patterns should have been avoided.
Passphrases with unrelated words should have been used to improve memorability and security.
Each account should have been assigned a unique password to prevent credential‑stuffing risks.
